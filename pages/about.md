### CELM at the Folger

CELM migrated from King's Digital Lab and its Kiln framework to the Folger Shakespeare Library in March 2024. As part of the transfer, the data and interface were preserved. Starting in 2025, the Folger plans to make corrections and updates to the content. Questions about the site and its contents should be directed to the Folger's Ask a librarian form.

Please also visit the Union First Line Index of English Verse for related content.

### History and Contributors

CELM is an online adaptation and extension of the Index of
English Literary Manuscripts 1450-1700, compiled by Peter Beal and
published by Mansell in four volumes between 1980 and 1993.

This online version was created between 2005 and 2013, with funding
from the Arts and Humanities Research Council from 2005 through 2010.
On the AHRC-funded project, Peter Beal was principal researcher into
new material and principal author of new entries; the size of the
catalogue grew by over 50%, from the 23,000-odd items of the printed
Index to over 37,000 entries. Most of the entries from the
printed Index were revised and extended, and the number of
authors catalogued more than doubled.

John Lavagnino planned the structure and functionality of the
digital version, supervised the work of converting the earlier printed
version into this new and extended form, conducted extensive tests on
the integrity and consistency of the resource, composed new entries,
and edited existing ones. Henry Woudhuysen monitored progress and
advised on policies, selection of material, and general scope.

At the Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London,
Elena Pierazzo worked on the initial planning of the web
implementation, and the work was subsequently completed by Jamie
Norrish.

Lucilla Corigliano Arioti retyped the entire text of the printed
Index to create the basis for CELM, rearranging and reediting
the material in the process. At a later stage of the project, Joanne
Wainwright undertook some further rearrangement and editing to move
many manuscript descriptions from the original introductions into the
body of the catalogue proper.

### Advisory Board

From 2005 through 2010 the project was aided by an Advisory Board,
whose members were:

* Peter Beal: Institute of English Studies, University of London
* Elizabeth Clarke: University of Warwick
* Katherine Duncan-Jones: Somerville College, University of Oxford
* Warwick Gould: Institute of English Studies, University of London
* Elizabeth Hageman: University of New Hampshire
* John Lavagnino: King's College London
* Jerome McGann: University of Virginia
* Brian Vickers: Institute of English Studies, University of London
* Claire Warwick: University College London
* Henry Woudhuysen: Lincoln College, University of Oxford

### Introduction by Peter Beal

In 1979, before the publication of my first two volumes of the
Index of English Literary Manuscripts, I wrote in my preface
that ‘one of the main aims of this Index is to point the way
towards further investigation, as well as to take stock of that which
is known’. I added to this an expression of hope that in ‘the
foreseeable future’, as new information came to light, there would be
an ‘eventual supplementary volume’.

I could not then predict the revolutionary impact of the new
electronic media or imagine that the Index would expand not
just to a ‘supplementary volume’ but to an extensive catalogue that
would be freely accessible online throughout the world. Neither could
I predict that in ensuing decades there would be such an upsurge of
scholarly interest in manuscripts—in the textual importance of
manuscripts, in the sociology of manuscripts, and in their makers and
their readers, among other aspects.
 
Now, over thirty years later, we are launching this online
Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts, 1450-1700 (CELM), which
was financed for five years by the Arts and Humanities
Research Council—to which, of course, we are very greatly obliged. The
project has been based at Senate House and in the Department of
Digital Humanities Humanities at King’s College London. While I am the
compiler of the entries and author introductions in CELM, the online
version was designed constructed, corrected, and proofread by John
Lavagnino, of King’s College London, and our general advisor, overseer
and occasional contributor has been Henry Woudhuysen of the University
of Oxford. I am, of course, extremely indebted to both of these
scholars—who have spent many hours of their busy professional lives
attending to CELM matters and giving me general support—especially in
view of my initial ignorance of electronic technology.

My original Index (published in four volumes, 1980-93) included entries for
123 authors of the period. The selection of authors was based on those
listed in the Concise Cambridge
Bibliography of English Literature, which was published in 1967. It is
a token of how dated that selection was that only a single female author
was represented: namely Aphra Behn. In effect I doubled the female
representation by also including Katherine Philips. By contrast, CELM now
includes nearly twice as many authors—237 at present—and of
those authors 75 are women, the selection of these deriving from the
representation of female writers of the period in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Admittedly some of
these ‘new’ authors have left little or nothing by way of manuscripts—in which case CELM simply serves to register that fact for the
record in the hope that more material will come to light in due
course.

As for numbers of entries—i.e, the brief descriptions of
individual numbered manuscript texts by all these authors—CELM
currently comprises over 38,000 entries, besides references to numerous other
relevant documents in the introductions to individual authors. We would
hope that these figures for both authors and entries will increase, since
this is only the first stage in what we hope will be an ever expanding
enterprise. We welcome corrections and additions to CELM—especially
since not all of the manuscripts recorded here have been examined at first
hand (though the majority have) and the accumulation of details over a
period of some 35 years does not make for as much descriptive consistency
as we would wish. We trust that periodically we will be able to take down
the catalogue briefly to incorporate not only corrections but also
details of newly identified manuscripts of our authors, or even manuscripts
of other authors of the period, that are brought to our attention by
readers (who will of course, be credited for such additions). This
flexibility is indeed one of the principal advantages of an online project,
as opposed to printed publication.

I would conclude by stressing
that, far from being a substitute for first-hand scholarly examination of
literary manuscripts of the period, CELM is quite the opposite. It is
designed purely as a guide to investigation and research. We sincerely hope
that it will encourage the study of early modern literary and historical
manuscripts and bring to ever wider attention the sheer wealth and importance
of archival material in repositories around the world, much of which is
still waiting to be properly explored.

### Acknowledgements

Besides my great debt to John Lavagnino and
Henry Woudhuysen, I am indebted, as I was in 1980 when the first volume of
my Index of English Literary
Manuscripts appeared, to all the librarians and curators, as well as
private collectors, who have made their manuscripts available to me or have
kindly taken the trouble to answer my queries about them. In addition I am,
of course, deeply indebted to the Arts and Humanities Research Council for
their substantial grant which supported the CELM project over a period of
five years and, among other things, made it possible for me to visit so
many libraries, record offices, and other collections, throughout Britain
and Ireland. Financed one-month visiting fellowships were also kindly
granted to me by the Huntington Library and Newberry Library (both partly
financed by the British Academy), by the libraries of Harvard and Yale, and
by the Folger Shakespeare Library, as well as by the Harry Ransom Center at
the University of Texas. I should add that I have also benefitted greatly
from the privileged access I
had to so many public and private collections in Britain and overseas, over
a period of twenty-five years, while employed by Sotheby’s, London.

Not least is the debt I owe to Professor
Warwick Gould, head of the Institute of English Studies, University of
London, who, in 2005, encouraged and facilitated the CELM project from its
inception. I am especially grateful also to the staff of the Department of
Digital Humanities at King’s College, London, who initiated me in
the relevant mysteries of electronic technology and without whose expertise
and assiduity there would be no CELM on the internet.
